                    <h2>How do I join the server?</h2>
                    <p>Joining the server is very simple. All you need to do fill out the
                    whitelist application and join our discord server. You cannot play on
                    the world unless you are a part of the discord server. You also MUST
                    be whitelisted in order to be able to join the world.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>How long will it take to get whitelisted?</h2>
                    <p>It could take anywhere from a couple hours, to over a day. The
                        server staff are not always available. It could take them some
                        time to get your application. Rest assured, your application
                        will be reviewed in due time.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Can I apply to be an admin or mod?</h2>
                    <p>Of course! Once you have been whitelisted, please DM any mod or
                        admin and let them know you would like to apply. There is a
                        separate application for each. If you would like to apply to be
                        both, you will have to fill out both applications.</p>

                            <p>Moderators help keep the server safe and fun for everyone.
                                They handle rule enforcement, assist players, and report issues to admins.
                                We're looking for friendly, fair, and active community members who know how to
                                de-escalate and stay cool under pressure.</p>

                            <h2>Admin</h2>
                            <p>Admins are trusted leaders who manage major aspects of the server—everything
                                from plugin setups to player disputes. They help shape the direction of the
                                server and support both staff and players. Admin roles are typically offered
                                to long-term, highly involved members with a strong track record.</p>
